Hearthstone Decks

This is my personal repository for keeping track of my decks, including versioning and everything.

You can try using these if you like, but they're all homebrew (except for jabberwocky jades), and aren't guaranteed to be optimised in any way shape or form.

Description of Decks
====================
Affliction Lock
---------------
This deck focusses on controlling the board until you get Lord Jaraxxus out and win from infernal overload. There's a bunch of life loss cards but that doesn't matter because Jaraxxus will get you down to 15 life anyway. There's a lot of taunts which may be an unnecessary number, but it helps protect some of the other key cards like Despicable Dreadlord and makes playing Jaraxxus a lot safer. 

The first iteration of this deck focussed heavily on the Affliction specialised spells such as drain life, drain soul, defile, Curse of Weakness, Curse of Rafaam and Shadowbolt. Eventually this turned out the way it is now with taunts and Jaraxxus. 

Bird Mage
---------
A deck made based on a theme first and foremost, and strategy second. This deck is focussed on the myriad of birds that Jaina gets and the spells that synergize with the available birds. Jaina has access to a variety of bird cards, a lot of which focus on spells. Currently the biggest problem with this deck is the fact that it wants both low cost spells (Vex Crow) and high cost spells (Medivh and Raven Familiar). Avian Watcher is also a tempting choice to add in, but it makes this high-low problem worse because it demands that secrets (3-mana spells) be put into the deck, which is difficult to combo with Vex Crow, but also not expensive enough to make Medivh/Raven Familiar effective. 

As 3 out of the available birds are also elementals, there is also the option to go with Elemental spell synergy. This would allow the use of Elemental Evocation, Flame Geyser and Scorch, all of which are cheap spells which would go very well with Vex Crow. Pyros would be great at enabling the Elemental spells as you get more Pyros's the more you play. It's worth playtesting a little bit but I haven't gotten around to trying this yet. 

Do not play this deck if you want to win. This deck usually does the exact opposite. 

Burn Shaman
-----------
This deck tries to limit the number of minions and focus on spells that burn the opponent down. The main strategy is to board control early, possibly putting down a Trogg or Elemental for some extra value, and draw as many burn spells as you can and finish the opponent off. To help you get enough burn spells, there's card draw such as Ancestral Knowledge and Spirit of the Frog, as well as Krag'wa for the recursion. Usually you end up with just enough burn to finish the opponent off, and sometimes, you might even get enough to finish off a Reno'd opponent. (If you get lucky.)

Coppertail Assassins
--------------------
This is a rogue deck with a dual theme of mechs and stealth, centering around Coppertail Imposters as the central card. There are stealth cards and stealth boosting cards such as Gilblin Stalker, Shadow Rager, Lotus Assassin and Shadow Sensei as well as mechs such as Clockwork Gnome, Bronze Gatekeeper, Sn1p-Sn4p, and Iron Sensei. The dual theme basically makes the deck unpredictable, but the general idea is to buff up your creatures with either senseis and magnetic cards to a high degree, while maintaining a consistent amount of damage each turn to get them low enough to finish them off. A lot of games will end up being won by a combination of the sharpsword oil and a well timed Conceal the turn before. 

Holy Dragon Sword (Dragon Priest)
-------------
This deck is a variant of dragon priest, except it has a holy theme to it. Or at least it tries to anyway.  

Druid of Steel
--------------
One day, Malfurion decided he'd had enough of wood, so he made a deal with Blingtron 4000 to get him a weapon. Thus he became Druid of Steel.

But more seriously, this is a deck based on Attack Malfurion, using attack buffing cards and lots of claws and possibly Gonk as well. Blingtron is sort of there as well, and if you high roll a Gorehowl for +7 attack, that's fantastic news and quite possibly puts the opponent at lethal range. 

Hakkar's Boomship
-----------------
The ragtag crew of Archmage Vargoth, Emperor Thaurissan, Kel'thuzad, Ragnaros, King Phaoris and Arthas all band together under the captainship of Hakkar the Soulflayer, who pilots the Legendary Boomship to victory. 

This is a control warrior deck, except instead of wearing out the opponent, it just plays everything at once with the Boomship. All minions in this deck are either high cost high value cards, or just plain high value cards like Vargoth and Thaurissan. The early game is mostly control based, with a few minion generating cards like I Know A Guy and Dragon Roar to give a bit of board control. The important part is they never start out in the deck so Dimensional Ripper and Boom Reaver can always get something good.

It's main weakness is Twisting Nether. Twisting Nether causes the ship to get lost forever. And probably lose the game unless you get lucky by drawing more big minions. 

King Phaoris is an iffy choice as a 5/5 with a battlecry, but due to the large amount of high mana spells, I'm willing to try him out. 

Jabberwocky Jades
-----------------
A Jade Shaman deck, but with the addition of Shudderwock (who originated from the Jabberwocky creature from the author of Alice in Wonderland, and has a far superior name to Shudderwock). It's very midrangey, but otherwise a standard jade deck. 

The addition of Corrupt the Waters/Heart of Virnaal would help the deck immensely. If only I had one. 

Lich King's Bane
----------------
This is the deck I used to beat the Lich King as Druid. No creatures below mana cost 3, and things to combat the frostmourne spirits like Spreading Plague are in it. 

Moral High Ground
-----------------
This is a priest deck that only contains morally good cards. The deck is heavy in low cost spells and buffs and heals, with an attempt to use Dragon Soul as well, because if you're playing a holy priest, golden spirit dragons are definitely a must. Unfortunately, most of the time this deck ends up drawing through your deck without doing much of anything. Currently looking for a finisher that fits its theme.

Test Subject is not allowed because experimenting on leper gnomes is frowned upon. However, Zerek is allowed because he only experiments on himself and has signed the relevant consent forms. To himself. 

All shadow magic is banned. That means most forms of removal that priest has access to is banned. The only removal left is mostly burning light magic. Or dragonfire. Man I wish there was some sort of Pacifism/Arrest spell in Priest. 

Overloaded
----------
A 32-card deck that somehow made its way into existence. Ironically, it focussed on overload synergy before getting into this state. Not meant to be played. 

Timmydin
--------
One of the most successful homebrewed decks I've ever made, this deck focusses on Divine Shields and Buffs. The central card is Djinni of Zephyrs, who copies all the buffs you make and if not removed, will almost certainly become unstoppable. Otherwise, the rest of the deck is Paladin good stuff that curves out very similarly to Secret Paladin from the olde dayes. (That's probably the real reason why it plays so well is because half of it was lifted from Secret Paladin)

Tip: Playing Potion of Heroism while Djinni of Zephyrs is out draws 2 cards. This is huge and gives an incredible amount of value. Saving Djinni and Potion of Hero for turn 7 is not a bad move cause it increases its chance of surviving by a lot, and makes it so you've already gotten value out of it. (Usually the other minion with divine shield can trade out)

Double'd Spikeridged Steed is also fantastic, giving an incredible amount of health and a minion too. 

A fun deck to play and great at doing the divine shield quest at the same time. 

Ragnaros and Faceless is there to back you up too. 

Unleash the Beast
-----------------
The oldest deck I've ever brewed, this deck has seen many changes since the nerfs to various cards like Scavenging Hyena, Unleash the Hounds and Hunter's Mark. But the core of this deck has not changed.

This deck is basically Midrange Beast, but it has The Beast in it. The dream combo is to Call Pet either The Beast or Tundra Rhino and smash the enemy's face in for an instant 11 damage at 7 mana. This is the namesake of the deck and winning the game this way gives you extra satisfaction that a bad legendary won you the game. Savannah Highmane and Bittertide Hydra is also there to back it up. King Krush is also great for the charge and if you're lucky, you might be able to play it on turn 5, which would be wild. The rest of the deck is more beasts that ensures some value from Call Pet is gotten. 

20/30 of the cards are beasts, 8 of which have 4 mana or more. This means there's a good chance that Call Pet will do something. Even if you get something lower than 4 mana, the 0 mana still makes it great for combo'ing it ahead of the curve with either Houndmaster or Tundra Rhino. 

Despite being named "Unleash the Beast", it does not have the spell Unleash the Beast. This deck is way older than that card.

Volcano Warrior
---------------
This deck is no longer being maintained, but the idea was to include as many fiery things into the deck as possible. Much like Bird Mage, it was made from a theme first and strategy second.

Warchief Thrall
---------------
This deck used to be a Horde themed deck, but it has sort of evolved to just be battlecry focussed. At some point, Elementals were added in and now it's an Elemental Battlecry deck. 

Basically a midrange deck. It doesn't really have a strategy beyond "Control the Board and win"

Warrior, Reborn (Ye Olde Warrior)
---------------
One of the oldest decks I've had. It relies on the good ol' warrior synergies of weapons and enragieos. Probably needs some refurbishment at this point.
